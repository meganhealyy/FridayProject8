# FridayProject8- Customer Feedback Application
This is a Python-based customer feedback application that allows users to submit their name, email, and feedback through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The submitted feedback is stored in an SQLite database.

Features:
Feedback Submission: Customers can submit their feedback via input fields for name, email, and message. The feedback is stored securely in a local database (feedback.db).
Password-Protected Data Retrieval: Admins can retrieve and view all feedback entries by clicking a "Retrieve Data" button in the GUI. This action requires entering a password for security, which can be entered in the console. The default password is yourpassword (change it as needed).
How to Run:
Install Python and ensure Tkinter and SQLite are available.
Run the Python script to launch the application.
To retrieve feedback, enter the password in the console when prompted.
